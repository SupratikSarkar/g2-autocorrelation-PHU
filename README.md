## g2-autocorrelation-PHU

This repository has codes to extract g2 autocorrelation function from PicoQuant .phu files.

Contents of the repository:
1. **g2_data.phu** is the file generated by PicoQuant.
2. **Read_PHU.py** generates a .txt file from the .phu file. To use it open the terminal, change directory to where the files are located and run:
   
   ```py Read_PHU.py g2_data.phu g2_data.txt```.
4. **g2_data.txt** generated from g2_data.phu.
5. The python notebook **g2_analysis_from_coincidence_counts_for_pulsed_excitation.ipynb** to extract the g2 autocorrelation function and plot it.
